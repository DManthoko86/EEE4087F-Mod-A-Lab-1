# EEE4087F-Mod-A-Lab-1

This repo contains the python source code that I used to perform the experiments for lab 1 of the Broadband Networks course.

For this lab, we were required to generate randomly positioned users for base stations at predefined locations. For each user position, the achievable rate Ra when connected to a base station is calculated for each base station. A user is connected to a base station that provides the maximum achievable rate. For more info, check the lab manual.

To run the code, open up terminal or command prompt/power shell and type `python main.py`.
